        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>With the release of Moonlight 2.0, we retired some older features to streamline performance and focus development on what really matters. If you miss something, let us know! We actively review community feedback, and if enough users support it, there's a good chance it could return.</p>

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>That's private. Moderation decisions are kept strictly between us and the individual involved. You're free to ask them yourself — but if they don't want to talk about it, we won't either.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Absolutely not. Demanding it gets you Plus Blacklisted — no Moonlight Plus for you.</p>
          <p>Moonlight Plus is earned, not handed out. Be helpful, active, and actually contribute. If you do, we might notice. But begging? That's a guaranteed no.</p>

          <span>🧪 How do I get early access to new features?</span>
          <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Early access (aka Beta Tester Rank) is invite-only. Even staff don't always get it. It's usually granted to long-standing, helpful members of the community who've earned trust. If that sounds like you, feel free to ask — just don't take it personally if the answer is "not yet."</p>

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Check your DMs — our system almost always sends a reason. Didn't get one or still confused? Hop into the HQ server and open a ticket. We'll explain or connect you with the moderator who handled the situation.</p>
